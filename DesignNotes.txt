Ideas:
	1. Re-render the output on each turn by the player (Console.Clear())
	2. GAME_STATE held in state machine, passed to UIRenderingService to display UI.
	3. Input from user captured, validated and processed by the RULES_ENGINE which updates the GAME_STATE
	4. Updates to game state causes a re-render 
	
States: Ready for Input

Inputs:

On moving position, display new position then process based on wether mine has been hit

If ran out of lives, display message to that effect and prompt for Reset or Exit
